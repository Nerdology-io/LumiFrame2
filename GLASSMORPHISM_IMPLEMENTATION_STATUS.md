## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED - Enhanced All Core Components & Settings Screens!
All core glassmorphism components and major settings screens have been successfully enhanced:

```dart
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Frame Configuration (with particle effects):
GlassmorphismContainer(
  config: GlassmorphismConfig.intense,
  enableParticleEffect: true,
  enableGlow: true,
  glowColor: context.accentColor,
  // Automatically includes 45σ blur, multi-layer gradients, floating particles
)

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Switch Tiles:
GlassmorphismContainer.light(
  enableGlow: value, // Glows when active
  glowColor: context.accentColor,
  // Enhanced typography, better styling
)

// ✅ IMPLEMENTED - Enhanced Settings Sections:
GlassmorphismContainer.medium(
  // Replaces basic containers with proper glassmorphism
)
```

```
Continue the glassmorphism restoration by implementing the remaining components:

1. PRIORITY 1 - Update all existing settings screens:
   - Replace GlassmorphismContainer calls with .intense() or .medium() variants
   - Add enableParticleEffect: true to main containers
   - Use proper glass buttons throughout

2. PRIORITY 2 - Enhance all input components:
   - Update GlassmorphismAuthInput with deeper blur and focus glow
   - Enhance slider inputs with glass tracks
   - Improve dropdown menus with floating glass

3. PRIORITY 3 - Implement screen-specific enhancements:
   - Frame Configuration dialog needs .intense() container with particles
   - Onboarding screens need aurora glass effects
   - Add floating orb backgrounds where appropriate

Use the new glassmorphism system in /lib/theme/core/glassmorphism_config.dart and the enhanced GlassmorphismContainer with named constructors. Focus on creating the most beautiful, luxurious glass effects possible.
